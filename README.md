# Realtime-Speech-Chatbot
This program takes microphone input in which a chatbot outputs an appropriate response.

TO DO:
        -When we want to use our speakers as input
            Perhaps instead of using stereo mix as the input for our device speakers we instead,
            Open a stream of our desktop audio using pyaudio and listen to that instead.
            If that doesn't work, perhaps attempt to setup a virtual input device using voicemeeter.
        -Create Chatbot that takes text as input
        -Get the Chatbot output and input that through a text to speech program
