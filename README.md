# Realtime-Speech-Chatbot
This program takes microphone input in which a chatbot outputs an appropriate response.

TO DO:
1) When we want to use our speakers as input:
Perhaps instead of using stereo mix as the input for our device speakers we instead,
open a stream of our desktop audio using pyaudio and listen to that instead.
if that doesn't work, perhaps attempt to setup a virtual input device using voicemeeter.

2) Create Chatbot that takes text as input
 
3) Get the Chatbot output and input that through a text to speech program
